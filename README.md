My background is  as diverse as it is dynamic. With a recent graduation from Henry Bootcamp, an intensive full-stack web design bootcamp, I've embarked on a new journey in the tech industry, ready to leverage my experience from working in Fortune 500 companies, medium size businesses, and entrepreneurial ventures. 

My professional voyage has seen me navigate roles ranging from marketing to logistics and event production, instilling in me a holistic understanding of business operations. This rich tapestry of experiences has equipped me with the ability to adapt swiftly, communicate effectively, and collaborate seamlessly across diverse teams – all essential skills in today's rapidly evolving tech landscape.
